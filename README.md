# About:
This is a project to learn how to make an interactive chatbot.

After working at an IT Helpdesk for a while I have come to understand that some questions are common and can be easily answered by an automated chatbot.

This chatbot has the cababilities to filter out common questions and leave more time for more complicated questions.

While this chatbot is made for an IT application, chatbots are usefull in many customer facing websites.

# How it Works
This chatbot was made with React.js for the frontend.

The backend is made with Node.js, Express and the Watson Assistant API from IBM.

The Watson Assistant handles the language proccessesing and analysis and can be set up in their UI for different cases.

# How to use it
To use the chatbot simply embed it on your IST Homepage or some customer facing webpage.

Then users can click the bottom left button to start interacting with the chatbot.

This chatbot has interactions focused around "open times", "internet issues" and "contact details"

There is also a section in the chatbot that displays the answers to some common issues. This would be updated by the IST Team.

# Author and Code
